 ## Memories by Team Animators

 Memories is a mixed reality experience where users can capture real-life 3D scenes with their smartphones and later re-engage with their memories in an augumented photo album. 

 For the hackathon, we created two core experiences of the project:
 - An mobile application that allows the user to capture videos, upload it to the cloud, so later, the user can get the photogrammetry model when it's processed.
 - A simulated AR experience created in VR that allows a user to page through a three dimensional photo album that invites the user to interaction with the photos and even to enter the scene.
